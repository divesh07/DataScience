There are lots of \\npossibilities out there for starting a business that will supplement your current income and perhaps eventually grow into your main income [20].Move Towards Your Passions\\nWhenever the opportunity presents itself, gravitate towards the things that really excite you, because passion is what will make you successful [21]. For me, my passion is writing, so I!ve made an effort to gravitate towards it by working on The Simple Dollar in \\nmy spare time. For others, it could be anything - maybe it!s leading a team, or perhaps it!s writing beautiful computer code. Whatever really excites you and makes you want to do more and more and more and better and better and better, that\\n!s what you need to move towards at all times [22].Don\"t Burn BridgesYou never know when a relationship you\\n!ve forged in your past might come in handy later on, even the ones you completely don!t expect. Thus, even if you feel wronged in a \\nsituation or want ÒrevengeÓ on some people - or even if you just feel an urge to spread negative gossip - resist it. As you get older, you\\n!ll Þnd yourself time and time again bumping into people that you forged relationships with earlier on - if you burned those bridges, you!ll Þnd that eventually you!ll have burnt that very bridge that you need to cross to get ahead. My advice? Never spread a negative word about anyone, because it \\nnever helps.Keep in Touch\\nWhen you do build a bridge with someone, don!t let it get old and worn out - spend the time to keep in touch with that person. Shoot them an email or a phone call every once in a while just to see what they!re up to. When it!s clear they need help and you can easily provide it, always provide it. I found the book Never Eat Alone \\nby Keith Ferrazzi [23] to be particularly powerful in this regard.
