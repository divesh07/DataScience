      "2069. I think I was in 7th std when I watched this movie. And the song sang by Shri Shankar Mahadevan ji was very soothing and soulful. It directly touches inner soul of heart and body. Every word of this song is really outstanding and meaningful and worthwhile. Till now I'm hearing and watching this song. Very soothing and soulful voice and background music. Thanks a lot to signing team of this song. I appreciate for releasing this song. God bless you All teammates of this song and movie which makes this movie superhit. सच मे खो न जाये ये तारे जमीन पर।\n",

      "2391. This is an emotion.. The most beautiful and sentimental emotion of the world..Child psychology ,the thinking perspective of a little kid, who is unaware of all the chaos going around..and just wishes to be loved,cared, be happy and cheerful  with his family.. but is abruptly burdened with lots of load and loneliness.. It's not always about how much you achieve, but about the happiness and satisfaction you get in every small step..A child is a bundle of joy and let's not harm this precious one...This movie teaches us lot many values and paves a way to make us understand that, everyone is unique in their own way..So no need of comparisons, depressions, judgements and stereotypes..Love and live ❤️\n",

      "3381. A person who is a divorcee in real life & is doing violence on his female co-actors in the movie Mangal Pandey. Showing his cruel & vulgar side in movies like Delly Belli ( the spellings I am not sure of) & Dangal & few songs like \"suriya jan legi kya.\" Such kind of a person is teaching to be kind to a child in 'Tare Zameen Par.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The harassment which the protagonist that is the child faces in Tare Zameen Par. Even I have faced the same in Sharukh, Salman & other celebs & their influenced staff led school St. Mark's because these people do verbal & physical violence on kids(FIR made). Even my pencil got broke while doing my physics diagram in ninth standard because of harassment at school.\n",
      "\n",

      "Instead of giving me to anybody in the name of extra class, where I would have been taught sexual abuse in the name of teaching. He took me to my room the day my pencil broke and took me to my beautiful well-litted room motivating me back. I felt fine because of his nice company and went to create my diagrams and read my chapters because I love my father & his efforts on me. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "This is not true when it comes to my father's love. In real love, you need endurance, care, appreciation, a little firmness over the child's character and it's not about one exam or a 3 hour movie. It is an effort in every moment made continuously for a very long time that is required to develop a child's sensible character.\n",

I REFUSE to participate in exploitation and scapegoating. Center perspectives of multiply marginalized: colonized. This intergenerational trauma came from some people's greed. I refuse to be an accomplice. I want privileged people to adapt to my perspective and communication style, make accommodations just like people do in other ways. I know it's possible when people already are accommodating wealthy whyte colonizers in decision-making positions making war and stealing people's resources; we need to stop accommodating abusers, and start accommodating people being disabled. If we have a choice and have basic needs met, let's not work for abusers where the technology becomes a weapon of war, climate change, and mass suffering. \n",

Thanks to the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, the perfect sacrificial lamb of God, He has once and for all disarmed the death and sin that the devil kept us bondage of and accused us of. By doing this, Jesus brought the authority of the Kingdom back to the earth so that we can no longer be enemies of God. If you confess with your mouth and believe with your heart that Jesus Christ died for us and rose from the dead, then you know you belong to God when He made you before the earth was created. Why? Because you are a witness to this gospel before the beginning of creation. So repent of all your sins by:\n",

So, don't wait a day longer because you never know when it is your time to go. \"Repent of your sins now or PERISH\". The choice is in your hands. Stop playing with your soul and ask yourself: \"where will you spend eternity after your death? Heaven or Hell?\".. God loves you too much to watch you perish.\n",
